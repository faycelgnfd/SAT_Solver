# SAT_Solver
This project aims to create a Java SAT solver using naive approaches such as BFS and DFS then heuristic methods precisely the A* algorithme using 2 different h functions.
This Solver can be tested on open source SAT Benchmarks available here : https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html . 
The specific benchmarks used during building stage are uf75-325 / uuf75-325 which include 100 instances each with 325 clauses and 75 litterals.
